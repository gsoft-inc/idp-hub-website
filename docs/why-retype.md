# Why Retype over GitHub readme

While GitHub `README.md` files are great, there are several compelling reasons to consider using a documentation platform like Retype:

1. **Better Structuring:** Retype simplifies the organization of documentation by allowing easy division into multiple files and provides an intuitive navigation system with a left sidebar for seamless browsing.

2. **Automatic Table of Contents:** Retype generates an in-page Table of Contents automatically from the page's headers, improving navigation within the documentation.

3. **Powerful Search:** Retype integrates advanced content search functionality, enabling developers to quickly locate the information they need.

4. **Broken Link Detection:** Retype's compilers swiftly identify any broken links (including anchors), ensuring that your documentation remains error-free.

5. **Advanced Code Block Features:** Retype's code blocks support features like [line highlighting](https://retype.com/components/code-block/#line-highlighting) and optional [titles](https://retype.com/components/code-block/#title), enhancing the presentation of code samples.

6. **Rich components library:** Retype offers out of the box a rich collection of [markdown components](https://retype.com/components/) that should meet the requirements of most documentation websites.

7. **Outbound Links:** Retype automatically identifies and manages external [(outbound) links](https://retype.com/configuration/project/#outbound) within the project, opening them in new tabs when clicked for a smoother user experience.

8. **Multiple Layouts:** Retype offers three distinct [layouts](https://retype.com/configuration/page/#layout) out of the box: `page`, `central`, and `blog`, allowing flexibility in presentation.

9. **Custom CSS:** Retype allows to add [custom global CSS](https://retype.com/components/container/#custom-global-css) and [CSS classes to containers](https://retype.com/components/container/#custom--class).

10. **The Hub functionality:** Retype's [hub functionality](https://retype.com/configuration/project/#hub) enables the interlinking of multiple websites, facilitating seamless navigation between related resources.

By choosing Retype, we can take advantage of these features to enhance our documentation's organization, accessibility, and overall developers experience.
